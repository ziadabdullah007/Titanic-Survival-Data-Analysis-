# Titanic-Survival-Data-Analysis

# Project Overview:

This project involved analyzing the famous Titanic dataset to understand the factors that influenced passenger survival rates. The primary focus was on data cleaning and exploratory data analysis (EDA), using Python along with libraries such as Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn to draw meaningful insights through visualizations.
# Objective:

To perform exploratory data analysis on the Titanic dataset in order to uncover key patterns and trends related to passenger survival, and to gain experience in data preprocessing, visualization, and analytical storytelling.
# Problem Statement:

The Titanic dataset contains missing values and inconsistencies that must be addressed before meaningful analysis can be conducted. Additionally, identifying patterns behind passenger survival requires a structured approach to data exploration and visualization.
 # Scope of Work:

  Cleaned and preprocessed the dataset to resolve missing values and inconsistencies.

  Performed Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to understand distributions and relationships within the data.

  Created visualizations using Matplotlib and Seaborn to explore survival rates based on gender, passenger class, and age groups.

  Documented analytical findings and proposed directions for deeper investigation or predictive modeling.

# Project Goals:

  Understand the demographic and socio-economic factors affecting Titanic passenger survival.

  Improve technical proficiency in data cleaning and EDA using Python.

  Develop compelling visualizations to clearly communicate trends and patterns.

  Practice documenting insights and making data-driven observations.

  Lay the foundation for future predictive modeling or classification projects .
